* Add a popup when we're downloading details.
* Notify user if there's nothing to download.
* Heart icon on main page for favorites?
* Grey out "Clear New" menu option when new list is empty.
* (Maybe?) Popup for downloading artist/concert lists, with button for clearing new list.
* If possible: no user-visible (translatable) text in lma library section.
