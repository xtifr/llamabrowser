Some of these will obviously end up generating subtasks

For initial release:

* Use home directory for config
** UI for configuring
* Note downloaded concerts
* Artist details (to match concert details)
* Add actual help
* Downloading enhancements
** add missing metadata to flac
* Concert stuff
** play songs?
* Better error handling
** when internet is off or download fails
** bad data from LMA
* Test suites
* proper i18n support
* Figure out and document licensing

Little tasks:
* Figure out how to handle nested songs (two directories deep)
* Add taper, etc. to concert details
* Add check for database version to protect against upgrades.

Longer term

* Support non-unix systems?  (mostly config / storage issues)
* Autoconvert shn to flac option
* Hide artists/concerts (just not interested)
* Discard concert lists for artists
** Add metadata too
* Allow interrupting and restarting downloads, by making use of the
  pubdate field we're already grabbing from the archive.
* Limit viewing artists by starting letter
* Limit viewing concerts by year
* Cache songnames
* Edit songnames (metadata)
** Update downloaded files
* Remove redundant artist name from concert name in concert list
* (Option): ignore leading "The" and "A" when sorting artists.
* Allow user to define arbitrary tags (similar to the favorites flag)
  and attach them to artists and shows, and then use them for selection.
  (Should be combinable with other selection methods.)
* reviews / stars
** browsing
** posting
* Alternative sorting options for display.
* Broad cross-artist Archive search for songs, etc.
  (Basically, formulate custom searches and handle the results specially.)
