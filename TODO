Some of these will obviously end up generating subtasks

For initial release:

* Choose favorites (artists and concerts)
* View concert details
* Downloading actual concerts
* Add actual help
* Test suites
* Figure out and document licensing
Little tasks:
* Reset the mode selection widget when showing the concert frame.

Longer term

* Remove redundant artist name from concert name
* Allow user to define arbitrary tags (similar to the favorites flag)
  and attach them to artists and shows, and then use them for selection.
  (Should be combinable with other selection methods.)
* Allow interrupting and restarting downloads, by making use of the
  pubdate field we're already grabbing from the archive.
* Limit viewing artists by starting letter
* Limit viewing concerts by year
