Some of these will obviously end up generating subtasks

For initial release:

* View concert details
** cache songs
** edit songnames
** play songs
** make display look better (notebook is better, but still needs scrolling)
* Downloading actual concerts
** update songnames (if edited) for flac and lossy
** add missing metadata to flac
* Use home directory for config
** UI for configuring
* Add actual help
* Better error handling
** when internet is off or download fails
** bad data from LMA
* Test suites
* proper i18n support
* Figure out and document licensing

Little tasks:
* Reset the search & selection widgets when showing the concert frame.
* Move to the top of the list when showing the concert and song frames.
* Figure out how to handle nested songs (two directories deep)

Longer term

* Allow interrupting and restarting downloads, by making use of the
  pubdate field we're already grabbing from the archive.
* Limit viewing artists by starting letter
* Limit viewing concerts by year
* Autoconvert shn to flac option
** Add metadata too
* Remove redundant artist name from concert name in concert list
* (Option): ignore leading "The" and "A" when sorting artists.
* Allow user to define arbitrary tags (similar to the favorites flag)
  and attach them to artists and shows, and then use them for selection.
  (Should be combinable with other selection methods.)
* reviews / stars
** browsing
** posting
* Hide artists/concerts (just not interested)
* Discard concert lists for artists
* Alternative sorting options for display.
* Broad cross-artist Archive search for songs, etc.
  (Basically, formulate custom searches and handle the results specially.)
