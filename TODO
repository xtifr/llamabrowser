Some of these will obviously end up generating subtasks

Big tasks:
* Add searching capabilities
* Remove redundant artist name from concert name
* View concert details
* Downloading actual concerts
* Allow interrupting and restarting downloads, by making use of the
  pubdate field we're already grabbing from the archive.
* Limit viewing artists by starting letter
* Limit viewing concerts by year
* Add actual help
* Figure out and document licensing

Little tasks:
* Reset the mode selection widget when showing the concert frame.
