Yeah, this is still too beta to have proper install instructions.
You can just change to the source directory and run './lmabrowser'.
It Works For Me(tm).  :)

Running lmabrowser will create a .LMABrowser directory in your home
directory, which will contain 'lma.db' (the sqlite3 database) and
'config', a small configuration file.  Knowing this will allow you to
poke around in the database, as well as to clean up if you decide you
hate the program.

The ambitious should note that there are three main components:
1) the 'lma' python package (the 'lma' subdir), which does the work.
2) the 'wxui.py' python module.
3) the (nearly empty) 'lmabrowser' script.

If you really want to try a "proper" install, you can put the first
two anywhere in your python search path, and the last somewhere in
your binary search path, and it should work.  But note that the
'wxui.py' module, at least, may be renamed, as the current name isn't
very expressive.

Eventually, I'll package all this up properly.
