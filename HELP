A quick introduction to LlamaBrowser.

The program has three main screens:

1) The Artist List screen, which shows the available artists,
2) The Concert List screen, which shows the concerts for an artist,
3) The Concert Details screen, which shows you songs and lets you download.

* Starting/The Artist List:

When you first start the program you should see an empty Artist List
screen.  You'll need to download the artists from the Internet
Archive.  Click on 'File->Download'.  This may take a few moments, as
the Archive has over 5,000 artists.  Once it's done, you should see
all the available artists.

** Preferences:

At some point, before you start trying to dowload any concerts, you will
want to click on "Edit->Preferences" to set your preferences, including
the default folder to save downloaded music in.  More on this later.

** Searching Artists:

In the upper left, you should see a search box.  You can enter an
artist's name (or part of a name), and press enter to limit the
display to just the artists that match your search.  For example,
typing "smash" should limit the display so that you can see "The
Smashing Pumpkins", or "zevon" will show you "Warren Zevon".

** Limiting the Display:

In the upper right, you should see a selection box with the folowing options:
1) All Artists -- show all available artists (limited by your current search).
2) Favorites -- just show artists you've marked as a favorite.
3) With Concerts - artists whose concert list you've downloaded.
3) New Artists -- artists downloaded since your initial download or since
   the last time you clicked on "File->Clear New".

At the moment, choosing any of these will show you an empty list, but
eventually this selector should be very useful.

** Selecting an Artist:

Once you find an artist you're interested in, double-click on their
name, and you'll go to the second screen, the Concert List screen.

* The Concert List

This is very similar to the Artist List, except for the "Back" button
in the lower left, which will take you back to the Artist list.

Again, this screen will be empty until you click "File->Download", just
like the Artist List screen.  It also has a search button in the upper
left, and a selection widget in the upper right.  It should all look
fairly familiar if you looked at the previous screen.

** Favorites

You now have an opportunity to mark an artist as a favorite.  If the
artist whose concerts you are looking at is one of your favorites,
click on "File->Mark Favorite".  To reverse this, click on it again.
A pop-up will tell you whether you have marked or cleared the status.
Once you go back to the Artist List screen, you will be able to find
this artist again easily by selecting "Favorites" with the selection
widget in the upper left.

** Searching / limiting the display:

Works just like it did on the Artist List screen.

** Selecting a concert:

Again, double-click on the concert you're interested it.  This will
automatically download concert details, so make sure you're online
before attempting it.

* The Concert Details:

This is the third and final main screen of the program.  Here you will
see a notebook with two tabs.  One, "Details", shows descriptive text
about the concert, while the other, "Songs", shows a list of songs,
with the lossless format (Flac or Shorten) and whether lossy formats
(Ogg Vorbis & MP3) are available.

** Favorites

Again, you can mark this concert as one of your favorites by clicking
"File->Mark Favorite".

** Downloading Concerts

Simple: click on "File->Download", and you will go to the download screen
where you can choose the format, the download directory, and (if you want)
deselect individual songs.  The format is important!  By default (unless
you changed your preferences), you will be downloading lossless files
(Flac or Shorten).  These are big!  If you want lossy files like Ogg Vorbis
or MP3, choose that format!  The download screen will show you the total
size of all the files you'll be downloading.

Note that some concerts won't have lossy formats available.  In that case,
your only option is to download the lossless files, and convert them
yourself, if you want, or to choose another concert.

One potentially confusing bit is the "Artist Subdirectory" checkbox,
which is selected by default.  See the explanation of the Preferences
Screen below for details.

* Preferences Screen:

You can get here from anywhere by clicking "Edit->Preferences".  This
is where you can set the default download directory.  You can also set
a different default directory for lossless files, if you don't want
those to go into your regular music player's directory.  You can also
choose your preferred download format: either "lossless" (which will
depend on the files available), or one of Ogg Vorbis (best), VBR MP3
(medium), or 64KMP3 (low quality, but small).

You can also choose whether to use an Artist Subdirectory for your
downloads.  If you turn this off, all concerts from all artists will
be stored in sibling folders.  If you leave it on, each concert folder
will go into a folder named for the artist.
