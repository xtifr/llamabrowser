LMABrowser - A tool for browsing the 100,000+ free concert recordings
hosted at the Internet Archive's Live Music Archive (LMA).

LMABrowser consists of a general purpose library, which could
potentially be used as the basis of a plug-in for other tools, and a
simple graphical front end which allows you to immediately start
browsing.  You can mark your favorites for later reference.

LMABrowser is written in Python, using the WXWidgets toolkit for
(potential) portability.  At present, it is unlikely to work on any
system other than Linux or (maybe) BSD, but that could change in a
later release.  It uses SQLite3 for fast, reliable local storage of
artist and concert information.
