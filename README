LMABrowser - A tool for browsing the 100,000+ free concert recordings
hosted at the Internet Archive's Live Music Archive (LMA).

Written by Chris Waters <xtifr.w@gmail.com>

LMABrowser is written in Python.  It consists of a general purpose
library, lma, which could potentially be used as the basis of a
plug-in for other tools, and a simple graphical front end which allows
you to immediately start browsing.  Basic features include searching
and the ability to mark your favorite artists and shows.

The internal lma module which does all the work uses SQLite for fast,
reliable storage of artist/concert information.

The graphical front end uses the WxWidgets toolkit for (potential)
portability.  At present, it is unlikely to work on any system other
than Linux or (maybe) BSD, but that could change in a later release.

Library Requirements: python 2.7 (and its bundled sqlite3 module).
Front End Requirments: wxpython 2.8

The library is released under an MIT/X11 style license: see lma/LICENSE.
The main program is released under the GPLv3 or better: see COPYING.

My current to-do list is in TODO.
