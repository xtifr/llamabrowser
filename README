LMABrowser - A tool for browsing & downloading the 100,000+ free
concert recordings at the Internet Archive's Live Music Archive (LMA).

This is barely beta code.  It works for me, though(tm). :)

LMABrowser is written in Python.  It consists of a general purpose
library, lma, which could potentially be used as the basis of a
plug-in for other tools, and a simple graphical front end which allows
you to immediately start browsing.  Basic features include searching
and the ability to mark your favorite artists and shows.

The internal lma module which does all the work uses SQLite for fast,
reliable storage of artist/concert information.

The graphical front end uses the WxWidgets toolkit for (potential)
portability.  At present, it is unlikely to work on any system other
than Linux or (maybe) BSD, but that could change in a later release.

Requirements: python 2.7 (w/bundled sqlite3 module) + wxpython 2.8.

The library is released under an MIT/X11 style license: see lma/LICENSE.
The main program is released under the GPLv3 or better: see COPYING.

My current to-do list is in TODO.
Useless install instructions are in INSTALL.
Licensing information in LICENSE.
Quick-and-dirty get-started instructions in HELP.
